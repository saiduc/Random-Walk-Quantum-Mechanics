abstract = {Over a dozen ultracool dwarfs (UCDs), low-mass objects of spectral types {\$}\backslashgeq{\$}M7, are known to be sources of radio flares. These typically several-minutes-long radio bursts can be up to 100$\backslash${\%} circularly polarized and have high brightness temperatures, consistent with coherent emission via the electron cyclotron maser operating in {\$}\backslashsim{\$}kG magnetic fields. Recently, the statistical properties of the bulk physical parameters that describe these UCDs have become adequately described to permit synthesis of the population of radio-flaring objects. For the first time, I construct a Monte Carlo simulator to model the population of these radio-flaring UCDs. This simulator is powered by Intel Secure Key (ISK)- a new processor technology that uses a local entropy source to improve random number generation that has heretofore been used to improve cryptography. The results from this simulator indicate that only {\$}\backslashsim{\$}5{\%} of radio-flaring UCDs within the local interstellar neighborhood ({\$}{\textless}{\$}25 pc away) have been discovered. I discuss a number of scenarios which may explain this radio-flaring fraction, and suggest that the observed behavior is likely a result of several factors. The performance of ISK as compared to other pseudorandom number generators is also evaluated, and its potential utility for other astrophysical codes briefly described.},

@article{Ceperley1983,
abstract = {Random walks with branching have been used to calculate exact properties of the ground state of quantum many-body systems. In this paper, a more general Green's function identity is derived which relates the potential energy, a trial wavefunction, and a trial density matrix to the rules of a branched random walk. It is shown that an efficient algorithm requires a good trial wavefunction, a good trial density matrix, and a good sampling of this density matrix. An accurate density matrix is constructed for Coulomb systems using the path integral formula. The random walks from this new algorithm diffuse through phase space an order of magnitude faster than the previous Green's Function Monte Carlo method. In contrast to the simple diffusion Monte Carlo algorithm, it is an exact method. Representative results are presented for several molecules. {\textcopyright} 1983.},

@article{Li2011,
abstract = {Quantum ground-state problems are computationally hard problems for general many-body Hamiltonians; there is no classical or quantum algorithm known to be able to solve them efficiently. Nevertheless, if a trial wavefunction approximating the ground state is available, as often happens for many problems in physics and chemistry, a quantum computer could employ this trial wavefunction to project the ground state by means of the phase estimation algorithm (PEA). We performed an experimental realization of this idea by implementing a variational-wavefunction approach to solve the ground-state problem of the Heisenberg spin model with an NMR quantum simulator. Our iterative phase estimation procedure yields a high accuracy for the eigenenergies (to the 10-5 decimal digit). The ground-state fidelity was distilled to be more than 80{\%}, and the singlet-to-triplet switching near the critical field is reliably captured. This result shows that quantum simulators can better leverage classical trial wave functions than classical computers.},

The algorithm is an adaptation of the relaxation method for solving Poisson's equation, and is fundamentally based on the variational principle.
