#+TITLE: Random Walks for Quantum Mechanics
#+AUTHOR: Sai Pandian

* Usage
Make sure there is gcc installed on your system and you can compile the
lattice.cpp file with:
#+begin_src bash
gcc lattice.cpp -o lattice
#+end_src

For this reason, this code will probably not run on non-Unix systems.

If this compiles fine, then the Python file will execute correctly. The
plotcpp.py file is the main data analysis file. It will also automatically
execute the C++ file, so there is no need for you to compile and execute the
file yourself.

* Requirements
- Linux or MacOS system (untested on Windows)
- GCC Compiler
- C++ 11 or higher
- Matplotlib Python module
- NumPy Python module
- SciPy Python module
